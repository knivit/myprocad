                        The program needs Java 8 to be installed on your PC. Get Java 8 from
                        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle's site</a> or from
                        <a href="download.html">our site</a>. There is a chance that Java 8 is already installed.
                        <a href="../../download/myprocad-1.0.jar">Download MyProCAD</a> to your PC and double click on it in
                        Windows Explorer. In case Windows asks what to do with the downloaded file, install Java 8.<br>
                        To remove the program delete the downloaded jar-file. The program works without Internet access, it doesn't
                        need the LAN at all. To keep its settings the program creates .MyProCAD folder inside user's home directory.
                        This folder is small (about 1-2 KB) and it can be deleted at any time to reset program's settings.

                        The program works with projects stored in a file. At the same time a running program can work with several
                        projects. Or, you can start several programs and work with one or several projects in them. The point is,
                        you work as you like.<br>
                        The clipboard (i.e. if you have selected elements on a plan and copied them) have plain text format.
                        Using that, you can paste it, for example, to an e-mail, send it and a recipient will be able to copy the
                        text from there and paste it to its project. There are no any binary formats, closed information, restrictions -
                        we keep it open, simple and reliable.

                        A project contains one or more plans and notes. A plan contains walls, rulers, labels and level marks. At any time
                        a plan can be printed or saved as PDF-file.<br>
                        Go to "File", "New" to create a new plan named by default "My Plan". Let's rename it, for example, to "First Floor".
                        Click to "Name" property and enter a value and press Enter (fig. 1):
                        <div align="center">

                    <p>
                        Usually, a plan it is a horizontal section, i.e. making a floor, imagine that you are flying above a house and looking
                        down on it. Let us think that the walls of our house are Ytong blocks panelled by ceramic bricks. The first floor
                        is beginning at 60 cm above the earth's level. House's outer size is 13,600 mm by 10,600 mm. Now we will add the panelling.
                        Go to "Plan", "Create walls" and click on the plan anywhere around (0,0) coordinate. Move the cursor right and down
                        and set up the wall by a double click. You don't have to try to hit a coordinate exactly - the mouse is used to place
                        elements roughly. After that you can enter needed coordinates in the Property Panel (fig. 2):
                        <div align="center">
                            <img src="../images/brick-facing-1.png" alt="Brick's panelling" width="500" height="410"><br>
                            Figure 2. Panelling
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Switch off wall's creation mode by going to "Plan", "Select". Assuming that a brick's width is 12 cm do select the wall
                        on the plan (click on it) and enter in the Property Editor next values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>X Coordinate: Start (mm): 0; End (mm): 120</li>
                            <li>Y Coordinate: Start (mm): 0; End (mm): 13600</li>
                            <li>View: Pattern: brick</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The same is for front panelling (X: 120, 10600; Y: 0, 120), right (X: 10600-120, 10600; Y: 120, 13600) and
                        back (X: 120, 10600-120; Y: 13600-120, 13600). There is a useful feature: you can type an expression
                        like 10600-120, press Enter and the program will calculate the result. After the panelling is done let's review
                        the whole plan by changing the scale: "Plan", "Zoom Out" (fig. 3):
                        <div align="center">
                            <img src="../images/brick-facing-2.png" alt="The panelling is done" width="700" height="550"><br>
                            Figure 3. The panelling is done
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now start building the walls. Ytong block is 300 mm (length) by 190 mm (width) by 190 mm (height) size. Wall's width
                        is a one block. Zoom in the plan and set the first Ytong block in the right top corner. Select any pattern you like
                        for it. After that add a material: "Project", "Materials" (fig. 4):
                        <div align="center">
                            <img src="../images/kbb-1.png" alt="First block" width="850" height="580"><br>
                            Figure 4. The first block
                        </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Set up other blocks by copying the first one into a clipboard and have set Plan's paste operation to
                        "Plus Offsets to Selection". Close Materials' window, select the block and copy it (Ctrl+C). Let's build the
                        left wall. Click to the empty space to select the Plan and set the Paste offsets to X (mm): 0, Y (mm): 200,
                        Paste Operation: Plus Offsets to Selection. After that select the block and paste the new one by pressing Ctrl+V.
                        You will see the second block below the first. Press Ctrl+V again and again till the wall will be built.
                        Build other three outer walls and the inner one. You can select, copy to the clipboard and paste the whole wall.
                        In the end you should get the next (fig. 5):
                        <div align="center">
                            <img src="../images/kbb-2.png" alt="Walls done" width="650" height="500"><br>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that add other plan's attributes - labels, rulers and level marks. You can print the plan, get
                        material's report - and go out to made your dream a reality !

                        That's all, and by our meaning that's enough to start a construction. The main rule we kept in mind during
                        MyProCAD's developing this is "CAD it is simple". Good luck !
