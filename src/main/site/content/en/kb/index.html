                    <h2>1. What is the program for ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The program helps you easily draw house's plan using only a few graphical elements.
                        If you wish, you can create a material's library, assign the materials to the elements and the
                        program will calculate the needed amounts (in units and in cubic meters) and a price (if defined).
                        Results can be stored in a file, printed or saved as PDF-file.
                    </p>
                    <h2>2. How to install it ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Download its jar-file from our site <a href="../docs/download.html">MyProCAD</a> and save it somewhere
                        on your PC (on a desktop, for example).
                    </p>
                    <h2>3. How to remove it ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Remove the downloaded jar-file.
                    </p>
                    <h2>4. Is it a virus ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. The program doesn't change Browser's settings, doesn't use a network, doesn't listen ports,
                        doesn't spies for the keyboard, doesn't take screen shots. At any moment you can verify it by
                        installing it into a virtual PC, sending it to a online virus-scanner etc. Its compiled jar-file
                        isn't obfuscated and can be easily disassembled.
                    </p>
                    <h2>5. Can it damage anything on my PC ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        No. Below a full list of actions the program takes:<br>
                        a) Creates .MyProCAD folder in user's home directory to keep its settings there (1-2 KB);<br>
                        b) When saving a project, you do name a file to be saved;<br>
                        c) When opening a project, you to select a file to be opened.<br>
                        There are no actions with Windows registry, no shortcuts creation, it doesn't have an installer.
                    </p>
                    <h2>6. I have ideas how to improve it, what to do ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@myprocad.com?subject=MyProCAD">support@myprocad.com</a><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>7. Why the program is absolutely FREE ?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is absolutely FREE, because:<br>
                        a) We think that the more free software, the better;<br>
                        b) The program was developed using free software - Kubuntu, Subversion, Java, Maven, Intellij Idea;<br>
                        c) There are about 30% of code from another free project <a href="http://www.sweethome3d.com">Sweet Home 3D</a> in it.
